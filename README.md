In 2024 data science is having a moment with the explosion in generative AI fuelled by deep learning techniques and vast data collections. But the reality is that for all the technical advances, it comes back to humans. How are we collecting data? Why are we collecting it? What are our motivations for using it? How do we communicate? Getting to grips with modern data still requires that ancient skillset we've evolved - storytelling - and how we tell stories is changing. 

This toolkit is for anyone anyone working with graph data. It empowers users to create data stories and draw connections in real-time within immersive virtual worlds. Explore and query graphs using parameters relevant to you. Grapho productivity tools make taking a deep dive into complex data sets more accessible and engaging. It brings connections to life.

# History

Grapho started life as a spatial knowledge graph interface for a VR documentary [A Clever Label](https://acleverlabel.com) released on Steam in 2021 using a Neo4j backend. This was then spun out as a white label tool  [Grapho XR](#Grapho-XR) in 2022 for applied data science. Our first customer was [APNIC](https://www.apnic.net/). 

In 2024 a new ISO database language standard [Graph Query Language](https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html) was published (the first in 37 years since SQL) that defines data structures and basic operations on property graphs largely.

# Grapho XR

Grapho XR is a spatial graph visualisation tool and a new way to manage and present graph data. 

![one-pager-grapho-xr-tiles](img/one-pager-grapho-xr-tiles.png)

It's an interactive experience that feels like Minority Report meets 60 Minutes. Grapho provides flexibility to switch between data sets and between visual themes, ensuring the look is right for your audience. Display and take control of your data. Share knowledge in a hands-on intuitive way. Use it on-set as an interactive in-camera VFX solution.

Return to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents).

### Induction

Grapho XR is configured by defaiult with a "demo" graph database - a small set of actors & movies in cross-referenced pop culture 

* Reach out and grab the disk "Enter The Matrix" with the GRAB button
* Flip it upside down to open
* Grab nodes with the GRAB button
* Use the joystick to TELEPORT
* Use [FORCE PULL](#ForcePull) to grab nodes from a distance
* See [â€‹GraphSummitSydney2024-induction](https://vimeo.com/943161258/f7311ebf2c) for explainer video of the core mechanic using Meta Quest 3

NOTE Grapho XR's "desktop mode" (non-XR) support on Windows is provided for backwards compatibility, accessibility, and testing. We only recommend use of 3D visualisation on 3D displays for professional use given given research findings that 2D visualisation works better on a 2D displays. See [Dashboard](#dashboard) options for off-the-shelf and custom options.

## Interactivity

### Controls

Meta Quest Touch Controller layout

![controls](img/grapho-controls-quest.png)

### Passthrough (Quest only)

Toggle FACE BUTTON #2 button to switch between virtual environment and passthrough (see the real world through the onboard cameras). Passthrough (sometimes called Mixed Reality) can be great for new users unfamiliar with VR.

TIP Use this if real world surroundings make it too hard virtual objects.

### Teleport

![teleport](img/grapho-teleport.png)

Push LEFT or RIGHT joystick forward to show reticule and direction arrow on the ground plane. Rotate joystick to change direction of the arrow. This determines what direction you teleport. Release joystick to teleport. 

NOTE Users new to VR can get confused if they trigger teleport by mistake. You can change Settings > Teleport delay to adjust how responsive the joysticks are if this is a problem. 

### Grab

![grab](img/grapho-grab-button.png)

Use GRIP button to grab object (handle, node, relationship).

### Force Pull

![force-pull](img/grapho-force-pull.png)

Force pull is a telekinesis-like feature that lets you quickly grab an object regardless of its distance from you.

VR mode:
* Force pull - select object with the laser point extending from your virtual hand, pull TRIGGER and flick your wrist upward or to the side (like pulling a line on a fishing rod)
Desktop mode:
* Grab a node from a distance pressing G key and it will be force pulled towards the camera automatically

### Bump

Use natural hand movements to move objects out of the way

### Open Graph

![handle-open](img/grapho-handle-open.png)

Grab Handle. Flip Handle upside down to open graph nodes (run a query).

A Handle is a special type of node that is a convenient handle to a section of a graph that speeds up navigation and helps manage clutter.

You can think of it as a graph bookmark but technically it signposts a specify database query. I.e. the graph data returned may change.

Flip again to close graph nodes.

![handle-close](img/grapho-handle-close.png)

### Open Node

![node-open](img/grapho-datapad.png)

Press TRIGGER button to toggle opening and closing of a node to reveal its "Datapad" which shows the properties of a node. 

Settings > Open Datapad on Grab checkbox controls whether this happens automatically on GRAB. It can get annoying sometimes to have this on but useful as a default for new starters.

### Open Context Menu

![context-menu](img/grapho-context-menu.png)

Additional functionality is available while holding a node.

GRAB + <FACE BUTTON #1> opens a floating menu of buttons  

While keeping buttons pressed, move hand over the buttons to highlight them

Release <FACE BUTTON #1> to select highlight action.

Move your hand off the menu and release <FACE BUTTON #1> to close menu without doing an action.

#### Expand

Context Menu > Expand 

Any neighbouring node not already visible are spawned

#### Collapse

Any neighbouring node that was previously expanded (but not part of original query) is hidden

#### Hide

The node is hidden. 

To reveal node again you currently have to Close Graph and Open Graph again using the Handle

#### Hide Unselected

![hide-unselected](img/grapho-hide-unselected.png)

#### Pin
The node is pinned in place - moving neighbouring parts of the graph will have no effect on it

#### Unpin

The node is unpinned - moving neighbouring parts of the graph will effect its position

#### Bookmark

Not yet implemented. Sorry about that!

#### Settings Menu

![settings](img/grapho-settings.png)

Press SETTINGS button on Left Controller

NOTE - Changed settings are saved to your local device. There is currently no Reset Settings feature

![settings](img/grapho-settings-options.png)

* Restart (button) - restart application
* Arrange by type (toggle) - Check this to cluster all nodes by their given types (labels in Neo4j speak).
* Max nodes (spinbox) - limit how many nodes can be displayed at any time
* API URL (list) - choose from available Grapho API servers
* Database (list) - choose from available graph databases (per server)
* Refresh API (button) - re-run query. Useful for network troubleshooting
* Mouse Sensitivity - for desktop mode only
* Movement Speed - for desktop mode only
* Teleport Delay - increase delay to prevent accidentally use of teleport

# Grapho VM

Grapho VMs (aka "Grapho Virtual Machines") are Linux virtual machine containers that package Grapho online services to be used on your local device, on-premises hosting or on cloud platforms.

We use [packer](https://www.packer.io/) and [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) to keep on-premises and cloud-hosted virtual machine variants in sync.

Supported virtual machine platforms

* Linux Containers (LXC)
* Windows WSL2
* Docker
* AWS AMI
* Virtual Box
* VMWare

The default Grapho VM is a Debian LXC Container based roughly on the [VFX Reference Platform](https://vfxplatform.com/).
